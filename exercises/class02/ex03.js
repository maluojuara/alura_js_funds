//03. Create 3 variables of different types, use template strings to combine the different data types (number, string, boolean) into a single string, and display the result in the console

const varString = "hello";
const varNumber = 42;
const varBoolean = true;

console.log(`${varString}, I am ${varNumber} years old. Is that ${varBoolean}?`);
