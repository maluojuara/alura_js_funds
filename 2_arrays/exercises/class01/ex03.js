// 03. Create an empty array called 'myArray' and add 3 integer numbers of your choice using the push() method. Print the items present in the array to verify if the numbers were added. Then, replace the first element of the array (index 0) with double its current value. Print the updated array to the console to verify the change.

const myArray = [];

myArray.push(7, 98, 1676);

console.log(myArray);

myArray[0] *= 2;

console.log(myArray);
