1 - Create a file named data.json containing fictional information in JSON format. The file can represent, for example, product data, user data, or any other information you wish.

Create a file named useRequire.js and, inside it, use the require() function to import the content of the data.json file.

Print the imported content to the console using the console.log() function.

Access different properties of the imported object and print them to the console to verify data access.

id (number): Product identifier.
name (string): Product name.
price (number): Product price.

4 - Create a file named animals.json containing fictional information in JSON format. The file can represent data about animals, including at least three elements in the array.

Create a file named manipulationJson.js. Inside this file, perform the following operations:

a) Read the content of the animals.json file.

c) Add a new animal to the array of animals. The new animal should have a unique id, name, type, and habitat.

d) Modify the habitat of an existing animal in the array of animals.

e) Remove an animal from the array of animals.

f) Convert the modified object to a JSON string using JSON.stringify().

g) Print to the console the resulting JavaScript object from the operations.

5 - Create a JavaScript object representing information about a person. The object should contain the following properties:

id (number): identifier of the person.
nome (string): person's name.
idade (number): person's age.

Create a function that takes a JavaScript object and returns a new object. Use this function to make a copy of the original person object.

Modify the copy of the object obtained through the function, adding or changing at least one property.

Print both objects (the original and the modified one) to the console to verify that the changes made to the modified object did not affect the original object
